Linked List (single) is a simple data structure
  - stores data in ordered manner
  - sequence of elements,
    -- which links to the next element
  - can contain any type of data
    --  int, string, character
  - unsorted or unsorted
  - unique elements or duplicate elements

Difference between an Array and Linked list:
  - In array, elements are indexed
    -- constant time O(1)
  - in linked list, have to go through each element index
    -- each position is called the Node
    -- each node has a pointer to the next node
    -- linear time O(n)
    -- insertion and deletion is quick (at the beginning: before 0th index)
       --- constant time O(1)
    -- but appending takes linear time O(n)


DOUBLY LINKED LIST:
     - similar to linked list BUT
       -- links to the next element AS WELL AS the previous
