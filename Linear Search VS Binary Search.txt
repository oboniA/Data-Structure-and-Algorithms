Linear Search:
1. both SORTED as well as UN-SORTED array
   - starts checking from index0, and move forward
2. Time complexity is linear. O(n)
3. Sequencial assesment
   - assesses starting from index0 and goes up in order till the result is found

Binary Search: 
1. only SORTED arrays
   - take the middle index, and compare with it
   - discard the side that is not valid
2. Time complexity is O(log n)
   - descarding elements after comparison (invalid ones)
3. Random assessment 
   - chooses mid element that is depended on the highest and lowest index. 
   - removes invalid section after comparing
   - starts comparison with the remaining
   - mid = ( low + high ) / 2
