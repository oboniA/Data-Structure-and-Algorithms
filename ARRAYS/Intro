Python array module defines an object type which can compactly represent an array of basic values:
characters, integers, floating point numbers.
Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists,
except that the type of objects stored in them is constrained.

What are Arrays?
- linear Data structure
- collects elements of the SAME data type
- stores them adjacent memory locations
- arranged sequentially

Types of Arrays:
1. One Dimensional Array ( 1-D array)
    - 1 subscript to specify elements in the array
    - single row, n columns
2. Multi-dimensional arrays
     1. Two dimensional array (2-D array)
        - 2 subscripts
        - organized in a form of matrix;
        - collection of rows and columns (n rows; m columns)
     2. Three dimensional array (2-D array)
        - collection of 2D arrays
        - consists of 3 subscripts: block size, row size, column size

Operations on Array Elements:
- Traversal
  -- process of visiting each element once
  -- counts the array elements
  -- prints the stored values
  -- Sum of the elements
- Insertion
  -- include one or more elements in the array
     --- at the beginning/middle O(n)
     --- at the end O(1)
     -- at any given index of the array
- Deletion
  -- removes a desired array
     --- at the beginning O(n)
     --- at the end O(1)
     --- at any given index of the array
- Searching
  -- if a certain key is present in the array or not
  -- algorithmic process to find a particular item in a collection of data
- Sorting
  -- array sorted in a user defined order; eg. numerical, alphabetical, increasing, decreasing
  -- ascending order by default

Advantages:
- stores multiple elements of same data type
- can be accessed randomly using index number
- predefined memory, so no extra memory loss
- avoid memory overflow
- 2D arrays can represent the tabular data in an efficient way

Disadvantages:
- should always be predefined; can't add extra element at the last moment
- static in nature; size cannot be varied after declaration (can be resized in python)
- insertion and deletion is difficult because elements stored in continuous form
- allocating excess memory that required may lead to memory wastage
