String:
A string is a
      - sequence of characters that can be a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
      - can be declared using single quotes, double quotes, or even triple quotes.
The quotations are not a part of a string
      - they define only starting and ending of the string.
      - Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
Strings are immutable
      - they cannot be changed.
        -- Updating or deletion of characters from a String is not allowed
        -- new strings can be reassigned to the same name.
      - Each element of the string can be accessed using indexing or slicing operations.
Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters.
      - a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

Lists: one of the most powerful data structures in python.
Lists are sequenced data types.
  - just like the arrays declared in other languages
    -- dynamically sized
  - is a collection of things, enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas
  - empty list is created using list() function.
  - need not be always homogeneous.
    -- makes it the most powerful tool in Python
  - Lists are mutable
    -- they can be altered once declared.
  - A single list can contain strings, integers, as well as other objects.
  - can also be used for implementing stacks and queues.
  - The elements of list can be accessed using indexing and slicing operations.
  - Complexities for Creating Lists
    -- Time Complexity: O(1)
    -- Space Complexity: O(n)

Tuple:
A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects.
  - Tuples are just like lists
    --exception that tuples cannot be changed once declared.
  - sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type
  - they are indexed by integers.
  - tuple are syntactically separated by ‘commas’.
  - define a tuple by closing the sequence of values in parenthese
  - usually faster than lists.
