1) What's the simplest possible output?
        Base Case

2) Play around with examples and visualize:
        n=1/2/3/4/5/6

3) Relate hard cases to simpler cases:
        can you relate sum(3) and sum(4)?
        if we know the answer to sum(3) (where n=3), we can add 4 to sum(3) to get sum(4)

4) Generalize the pattern

5) write code by combining recursive pattern with the base problem
