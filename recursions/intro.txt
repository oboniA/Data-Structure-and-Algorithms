write a recusrive Function that given an input n
sums all the non-negative integers upto n
          sum(0) -> 0
          sum(1) -> 1
          sum(4) -> (1+2+3+4)
          sum(n) -> (1+2+3+.....+n)

1) What's the simplest possible output?
        sum(0) -> 0  (base case)

2) Play around with examples and visualize:
        n=1/2/3/4/5/6

3) Relate hard cases to simpler cases:
        can you relate sum(3) and sum(4)?
        if we know the answer to sum(3) (where n=3), we can add 4 to sum(3) to get sum(4)

4) Generalize the pattern

5) write code by combining recursive pattern with the base problem
